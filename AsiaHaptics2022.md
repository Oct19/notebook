## Sun Fuchun - TsingHua University - Problems and Solutions in Tactile Perception

### Magnetic field fingertip tactile sensor

- 3D hall sensor
- multipolar magnetic particles
- Use LSTM model for data processing

### Attach tactile sensor to forearm to sense hand motion intention

## Hou Zengguang - China Science - Rehabilitation

### Brain Stroke types

- Ischemic: blockage of blood flow
- Hemorrhage: blood vessel break

### Active interaction control strategies

- Impedance-Based Active Control
- EEG: Electroencephalography, electrogram of the brain
- EMG: threshold, proportional, computational, muscle model
- Interaction-control based on more info: eye, tongue, skeletal motion

### Future uses in China

- Mainly in hospital with supervision of therapists. For home use, robot will have fewer DOF

## Bill Townsend - Barrett President and CEO - WAM, Cable-driven force feedback robot

### Puck servo motor controller

### For robot, safe is not a state, it is the goal. Robot is not safe, it is SAFER

### N+1 cable for N DOF

### Cable break during operation?

- Gear drive is teeth biting into each other, cable instead can be very powerful such as elevator lift cable
- After training, changing cable can be easy as changing gear

### Cable driven mechanism is challenging in academic area due to string theory

## Jee-Hwan Ryu - Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology(KAIST) - Passivity-based Approaches for Stable and Transparent Haptics

### K-flex: surgical robot

### Impedance control

- Measure position, command force
- Stabilization problem: hitting hard object, hard object surface following
- Solution: add damping and shift impedance range, limit stiffness and limit impedance range

### Passivity

- Energy supplied by the network can never exceed the energy which was feed into.
- Passivity observer(PO) can measure energy flow in real time
- Passivity controller(PC) can dissipate energy
- Considering multi-port, where to place PC?
- Considering time delay for tele-operation

### Force control

- Measure force, command position, non back-drivable
- Explicit force control

### Successive force augment approach

### Admittance type control for dental applications

## Xu Yingqing - Tsinghua University -  For visually impaired

### Paper based tactile graphics: difficult to make, hard to preserve

### Braille

- Chinese Braille is based on Pinyin
- music, math, and physics has special Braille
- Distance between points: 2.5mm
- Smaller bandwidth than vision
- 3D to 2D

### fMRI experiment

- Blind people hand kinesthetic area is not larger than normal people
- While using braille, vision area of the brain is also activated

### Graphical tactile display desktop

- Display primary school geometry way faster than textbook
- Add active reading guidance ring: put fingertip inside the ring, the ring will scan through the 2D surface

### Any needs for graphical input?

- Blind people need guidance from normal people to "correctly" display the picture
- One famous example: 7 year old child draw to horizontal line and one vertical line, saying this is bus(two stairs plus handrail)

## Sun Xiaoying - Jilin University - Mobile device tactile technology

### Sense max delay

- Hearing 100ms
- Vision 10ms
- Tactile 1ms (larger than 1ms will cause tactile dizziness)

### Usage

- iPhone tactile home button
- Tesla control screen (no tactile feedback, which will make input action 50% slower, higher risk)
- For visually/hearing impaired
- For experiencing specific surface materials
- Writing on iPad mimic writing on paper
- Virtual keyboard
- Multi-point touch
- Flexible screen

### Methods

- Vibrations: easy, low resolution
- Static charge: low power usage, high resolution, need fingertip sliding to feel, but highly effected by environment and user hand condition
- Air bar
- Mechanical: wearable device
- Stylus

## Tian Feng - Chinese academy of sciences - Natural human-computer interaction(HCI)

### Natural interaction

- Non precise, continuous, multi-channel

### Non-contact RFID chip sensor

### Forearm EMG sensor detect hand holding object

### Distance sensor on finger ring to detect hand gesture

### Clicking moving object on screen using curser. Detect user intension based on object size, object speed, and base line

### Moisture simulation through temperature, pressure sensor and friction

### Pain simulation and moderation based on micro channel flow control and chile spice

### Vibration ring using small metal ball based on micro flow channel control

### Analyze mobile app user gesture input to determine health

---

## Yu Xinge - City University of Hong Kong - Tactile device

### Hydrogel glove with printed sensors and actuators(TENG)

- Human control robot: eye for crude control, glove for precise control

### Q: When will full body tactile suit be available?

- Big progress in next 5 years

## Seokhee Jeon - Kyung Hee University, Korea - Metaverse Haptics

### Metaverse is still mostly imagination

### Supramodal entertainment orchestrates audiovisual integration
